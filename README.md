# Student Performance Factors

## Project Overview
This project explores factors that influence student performance by analyzing a publicly available dataset (e.g., from Kaggle). The aim is to preprocess, analyze, and derive insights to answer meaningful research questions about student performance.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Statistical analysis and modeling.
- Visualization of key insights.

## Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KhoaUs/PDataScience.git
   cd PDataScience
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook project.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Follow the steps outlined in `project.ipynb` to preprocess the data and perform analyses.
- Modify the notebook as needed to address additional research questions.
